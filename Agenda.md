    > Pretend for a moment that I've analyzed a form all the way through 3NF

    ### Final Set of Entities

    **Student**: StudentID(PK), FirstName, LastName

    **CourseRegistration**: StudentID(PK|FK1), CourseID(PK|FK2), EnrolmentStatus, CurrentTerm

    **Course**: CourseID(PK), Name, Credits, TotalHours
    ```

    ```mermaid
    erDiagram
        Student {
            text StudentID "PK"
            text FirstName
            text LastName
        }

        CourseRegistration {
            text StudentID "PK|FK1"
            text CourseID "PK|FK2"
            text EnrolmentStatus
            text CurrentTerm
        }

        Course {
            text CourseID "PK"
            text Name
